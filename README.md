jTrapKATEditor - a JVM TrapKAT SysEx Editor
===========================================

With the slow demise of MONO precluding my using .Net on anything except
MSWindows, I have given in and decided to port my TrapKAT SysEx Editor
to the JVM.

The target is to have it feature (and probably bug) identical.
