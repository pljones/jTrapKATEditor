<h1>Change Summary</h1>
<p>14-1231-2158 Fix to switching note display modes (collateral damage from previous update...)</p>
<p>14-1223-2237 Hopefully a final end to the nasty bug in Windows where the lower part of the display stopped updating - but may be buggy elsewhere (due to rewriting a lot).</p>
<p>14-1114-2003 More tooltips, more undo/redo and, as ever, a few "tweaks".</p>
<p>14-1104-2158 Tooltips and Undo/Redo are the highlights, along with sundry bug fixes.</p>
<p>14-1012-1439 Pasting or Swapping a pad into a kit will check if it needs to be set to Various (and ask).</p>
<p>14-1006-2105 Remember location on screen.  Swapping pads now gets LinkTo right on V4 kits and does a fair job with hi-hat pads.</p>
<p>14-0929-2123 Fix update checker some more.  Fix Pad24 colour.  Fix pad flag 7 for hi-hat setting.  Some more work on kit and pad swaps.  Prettify Global panel</p>
<p>14-0922-2201 Highlight current pad; highlight Edit-Swap if there's something ready to swap and clear the clipboard after a swap; internal bits...</p>
<p>14-0916-1214 Fixed a third, rather small but important bug: the auto-update checker was not being run!</p>
<p>14-0916-1051 Fixed two bugs: writing Kit Dumps was broken; cut-n-paste Kit also did not work</p>
<p>14-0907-1322 Wrote the preferences system (replacing the JVM default one - avoids the Windows Registry)</p>
<p>14-0901-2002 Added the Edit menu (which I'd forgotten about...)</p>
<p>14-0825-2114 Added the Global tab</p>
<p>14-0824-1931 Fixed a rather large breakage of keyboard navigation</p>
<p>14-0804-2248 Completed pad editing</p>
<p>14-0712-2154 was the first somewhat "controlled" release with its own web page</p>
<p>Older changes and fuller descriptions are provided over on the <a href="http://www.alternatemode.com/forum/index.php?topic=4140.0">AlternateMode</a> forum thread.</p>
