<h1>Change Summary</h1>
<p><a href="releases/v15-1218-2238.html">15-1218-2238</a> Fix to V4 sound control editing.</p>
<p><a href="releases/v15-0906-1821.html">15-0906-1821</a> &quot;Version 1.00&quot;!  Migrated to GitHub for updates and help.  Fixed checking for updates and launching browser on Linux.  Also added warranty and licence info.</p>
<p><a href="releases/v15-0127-1304.html">15-0127-1304</a> Minor fix to editing kit name (some more fall-out; resulted in a bit of an improvement to the code, which was nice).</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-1231-2158.html">14-1231-2158</a> Fix to switching note display modes (collateral damage from previous update...)</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-1223-2237.html">14-1223-2237</a> Hopefully a final end to the nasty bug in Windows where the lower part of the display stopped updating - but may be buggy elsewhere (due to rewriting a lot).</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-1114-2003.html">14-1114-2003</a> More tooltips, more undo/redo and, as ever, a few "tweaks".</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-1104-2158.html">14-1104-2158</a> Tooltips and Undo/Redo are the highlights, along with sundry bug fixes.</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-1012-1439.html">14-1012-1439</a> Pasting or Swapping a pad into a kit will check if it needs to be set to Various (and ask).</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-1006-2105.html">14-1006-2105</a> Remember location on screen.  Swapping pads now gets LinkTo right on V4 kits and does a fair job with hi-hat pads.</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0929-2123.html">14-0929-2123</a> Fix update checker some more.  Fix Pad24 colour.  Fix pad flag 7 for hi-hat setting.  Some more work on kit and pad swaps.  Prettify Global panel</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0928-2020.html">14-0928-2020</a> Several small - but handy - changes.  Most usefully on swap kit and pad.</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0922-2201.html">14-0922-2201</a> Highlight current pad; highlight Edit-Swap if there's something ready to swap and clear the clipboard after a swap; internal bits...</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0916-1214.html">14-0916-1214</a> Fixed a third, rather small but important bug: the auto-update checker was not being run!</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0916-1051.html">14-0916-1051</a> Fixed two bugs: writing Kit Dumps was broken; cut-n-paste Kit also did not work</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0907-1322.html">14-0907-1322</a> Wrote the preferences system (replacing the JVM default one - avoids the Windows Registry)</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0901-2002.html">14-0901-2002</a> Added the Edit menu (which I'd forgotten about...)</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0825-2114.html">14-0825-2114</a> Added the Global tab</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0824-1931.html">14-0824-1931</a> Fixed a rather large breakage of keyboard navigation</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0819-1812.html">14-0819-1812</a> Mostly time wasted but some additional controls now work</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0804-2248.html">14-0804-2248</a> Completed pad editing</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0803-1716.html">14-0803-1716</a> fixed various bugs...</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0802-1845.html">14-0802-1845</a> displays kits</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0720-1822.html">14-0720-1822</a> seems to have sneaked out without much mention, if at all</p>
<p><a href="releases/v14-0712-2154.html">14-0712-2154</a> was the first somewhat "controlled" release with its own web page</p>
<p>
Initial development (and the old C# version) are covered over on the <a href="http://www.alternatemode.com/forum/index.php?topic=4140.0">AlternateMode</a> forum thread.
The thread also has a few more random thoughts as I go along, too.
