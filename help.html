                <h2>Getting the program</h2>
                <p>
                    You only need one file: <a href="jTrapKATEditor.jar" title="jTrapKATEditor.jar">jTrapKATEditor.jar</a>.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Installing the program</h2>
                <p>
                    The program itself needs no installation.
                    However, it depends on Java Runtime 1.8, which is usually already installed but, if not, is available from
                    Oracle, at <a href="http://java.com/en/download/" target="_blank" title="Oracle Java Download">http://java.com/en/download/</a>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="1_3_runningTheProgram">
                <h2>Running the program</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you have downloaded the program, running it should just be a matter of double-clicking the <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="hilite">jTrapKATEditor.jar</span> file.
                    If installed correctly, the Java Runtime should execute the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program can be run from the command line using the following command (assuming the java executable is in your PATH):
                    <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="hilite">java -jar jTrapKATEditor.jar</span>.
                </p>

        <div id="2_overview">
            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
                This section briefly runs through how to use the program without stepping through each feature.
                The <a href="#3_features">next section</a> covers each part of the program in more detail and then
                <a href="#4_details">the final section</a> explains each element of the user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that familiarity with both the TrapKAT and the TrapKAT manual are assumed (though some references are supplied).
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of this section also assumes you have the program installed and it starts up okay.
            </p>

            <div id="2_1_settingUpANewKitLayout">
                <h2>Setting up a new kit layout</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you have a new sound source for your TrapKAT and the layout is similar but not exactly the same as another kit
                    you already have mapped up.
                    Let us assume you have no reason to change the sound source to match the TrapKAT and that the TrapKAT has a spare user kit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are the steps you will need to follow to set up a new kit layout:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Get the current TrapKAT All Memory Dump onto your computer.</li>
                    <li>Edit the dump with <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="hilite">jTrapKATEditor.jar</span> to copy the similar kit and make changes.</li>
                    <li>Save the edited dump.</li>
                    <li>Send the updated dump back to the TrapKAT.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The first and last points are outside the scope of what jTrapKATEditor offers and differ substantially depending on whether you are running
                    on Windows, MacOS or Linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Windows, I still recommend MIDI-OX for receiving and sending MIDI System Exclusive dumps such as these.
                    Receiving the dump using MIDI-OX is straight forward and no special settings are needed.
                    The transmit settings for sending the dump - which are &quot;delicate&quot; due to timing issues - are given at the bottom of the
                    <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="hilite">jTrapKATEditor.jar</span> main window.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="2_2_loadTheDump">
                <h2>Load the dump</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you have got the TrapKAT All Memory Dump onto your computer,
                    run <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="hilite">jTrapKATEditor.jar</span>.
                    It starts up with some rather useless default values but we are going to ignore those and load the dump.
                    You can use the <span class="hilite"><span class="u">F</span>ile</span> menu, <span class="hilite"><span class="u">O</span>pen...</span> entry
                    or press <span class="hilite">Ctrl/Cmd O</span>.
                    This will bring up the following dialog box (or appropriate windowing system-specific flavour).
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="img/LoadSysex.png" title="Loading a SysEx dump" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    You will notice that it filters for Sysex files.  It expects an extentions of &quot;syx&quot; to be used.
                    If you did not save the received dump with that extension, I would recommend doing so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also very strongly recommend having a separate &quot;working copy&quot; file that you use for testing new and changed layouts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Select the file you saved and press <span class="hilite">Enter</span> or click <span class="hilite">Open</span>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="2_3_copyOneKitToAnother">
                <h2>Copy one kit to another</h2>
                <p>
                    The main display should now look similar to the following.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="img/Pads_PadEdit.png" title="Pad editing view" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Note that the <span class="hilite">Kits &amp; Pads</span> main tab is selected as is the <span class="hilite">Pad Details</span> subsidiary tab.
                    As this was a Version 4 dump (indicated in the title bar as &quot;(V4)&quot; after the file name), the <span class="hilite">More Slots</span> tab is available
                    as well as <span class="hilite">Kit Details</span>.
                    For this example, we will leave the tabs alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just below the <span class="hilite">Kits &amp; Pads</span> tab itself is the <span class="hilite">Select <span class="u">K</span>it</span> drop-down.
                    Select the base kit that is going to be copied.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="img/SelectKit.png" title="Kit selection" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    The pads now show the values for this newly selected kit, including the kit name.
                    We want to copy this kit to one of the spare (&quot;Demo Kit #XX&quot;) entries.
                    For this, select <span class="hilite"><span class="u">E</span>dit</span>-&gt;<span class="hilite">Copy Kit</span>.
                    This places a copy of the kit on the system clip board, so it can be pasted elsewhere (even after closing the program).
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="img/EditCopyKit.png" title="Copying a kit" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Next we need to switch kits and do just that.
                    So, use the <span class="hilite">Select <span class="u">K</span>it</span> drop-down to switch to the free kit and then
                    <span class="hilite"><span class="u">E</span>dit</span>-&gt;<span class="hilite">Paste Kit...</span>.
                    This pops up and dialog asking for confirmation of the action, as shown (with appropriate names and numbers).
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="img/RenumberKitOnPaste.png" title="Renumber on paste prompt" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Select <span class="hilite"><span class="u">Y</span>es</span> and the kit is overwritten with the copy.
                    Note that the kit number is held for each kit - if you send a single kit to the TrapKAT, it uses this to know
                    which user kit to write into.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice the title bar now has &quot;[*]&quot; at the end - indicating the file being edited has been altered but not saved.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="2_4_changeTheKitLayout">
                <h2>Change the kit layout</h2>
                <p>
                    We chose the source kit as &quot;similar to but not the same as&quot; what we need.
                    The things we want to alter are as follows.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The kit name</li>
                    <li>The way the hi-hat works</li>
                    <li>The pads for china and ride</li>
                    <li>The note for the kick drum</li>

                    <h3>Change the kit name</h3>
                    <p>
                        Changing the kit name is as simple as entering the new name in the <span class="hilite">Name</span> text field.  Done!
                        Notice that the kit is marked &quot;Edited&quot; next to the <span class="hilite">Select <span class="u">K</span>it</span> drop-down.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="2_4_2_setUpTheNewHihat">
                    <h3>Set up the new hi-hat</h3>
                    <p>
                        For this example, assume the old kit only had &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;bell&quot; hi-hat sounds,
                        these mapped to pads 1 and 11.
                        For the new kit, we now have &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;variable (CC4)&quot; hi-hat sounds we want to trigger from pad 1
                        and the &quot;bell&quot; sound is unchanged.
                        This means pad 1 needs to be marked as a hi-hat pad and to trigger two notes: one for when the hi-hat pedal is closed and one
                        for when the hi-hat pedal is between (nearly) closed and fully open.
                        We will assume the kit was already set to use a variable CC4 hi-hat pedal.
                        The steps are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Set pad 1 to be a hi-hat pad</li>
                        <li>Select pad 1</li>
                        <li>Set slot 2 to be the variable note trigger</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Which pads are considered hi-hat pads by the TrapKAT is an interesting subject examined in detail later.
                        For now, look near the middle of the window, where you should see a set of four drop-downs.
                        Hovering with the mouse gets a short tooltip.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img src="img/ExampleTooltip.png" title="Hi-hat pad selection" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Use the first box (although that is not important) to select pad 1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now use the <span class="hilite">Select <span class="u">P</span>ad</span> drop-down to select pad 1 (if it is not already selected).
                        Notice that the pad is marked &quot;Edited&quot;.
                        (Note also the <span class="hilite">Flags</span> for the pad now have flag 7 checked.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we have to add the &quot;between (nearly) closed and fully open&quot; note.
                        For a hi-hat pad, odd numbered slots represent closed sounds and even are when the pedal is not fully closed.
                        So the new note needs to go into slot 2.
                        If you click the slot 2 dropdown, you will see the following.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <img src="img/SlotDropdown.png" title="Slot data entry" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        For this example, we do not need to use the special values, just enter the note.
                        I use note numbers - they are explicit and do not have octave offset confusion.
                        I will use note 66 in this example, so that gets entered in the text box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that is the hi-hat done.
                    </p>

                        Whilst this is pretty easy on the TrapKAT, remembering which edit mode to use and which pads to hit still takes some doing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All that is needed in jTrapKATEditor is to select the first trigger pad, then use
                        <span class="hilite"><span class="u">E</span>dit</span>-&gt;<span class="hilite">Swap Pads</span> or <span class="hilite">Ctrl/Cmd B</span>.
                        Switch to the second pad and repeat the action.
                        If you use the menu, you will see there is a checkbox next to the <span class="hilite">Swap Pads</span> menu option.
                        This is checked when you have selected the first pad and are ready to swap with a second pad by selecting the option again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that you can also swap pads between kits, although this is more complicated, especially if one of the pads involved was a hi-hat pad.
                        See later in the help.

                    <p>
                        Similarly to setting the hi-hat second slot, this is just a matter of entering the required note in the <span class="hilite">Bass</span> pad
                        text box.
                    </p>

                    Now that the changes have been made, they can be saved to disk.
                    You can either save the entire All Memory Dump or you can save just the kit that you have been working on.
                    As we were working on an All Memory Dump, saving as a kit would need a name specified.
                    For testing a single kit, it is probably worth doing as the kit sends to the TrapKAT more easily as it is smaller.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Save File dialog will appear with a suggested filename based on the kit name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having saved to a new single kit file, that file becomes the current file being edited.
                    The shortcut for save - <span class="hilite">Ctrl/Cmd S</span> - shown against &quot;Save All Memory&quot; above
                    will then be against &quot;Save Current Kit&quot;.
