        <h1 id="1_theBasics">The basics</h1>

        <h2 id="1_1_gettingTheProgram">Getting the program</h2>
        <p>
            You only need one file: <a href="jTrapKATEditor.jar" title="jTrapKATEditor.jar">jTrapKATEditor.jar</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="1_2_installingTheProgram">Installing the program</h2>
        <p>
            The program itself needs no installation.
            However, it depends on Java Runtime 1.8, which is usually already installed but, if not, is available from
            Oracle, at <a href="http://java.com/en/download/" target="_blank" title="Oracle Java Download">http://java.com/en/download/</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="1_3_runningTheProgram">Running the program</h2>
        <p>
            Once you have downloaded the program, running it should just be a matter of double-clicking the <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="hilite">jTrapKATEditor.jar</span> file.
            If installed correctly, the Java Runtime should execute the program.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program can be run from the command line using the following command (assuming the java executable is in your PATH):
            <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="hilite">java -jar jTrapKATEditor.jar</span>.
        </p>

        <h1 id="2_overview">Overview</h1>
        <p>
            This section briefly runs through how to use the program without stepping through each feature.
            The <a href="#3_features">next section</a> covers each part of the program in more detail and then
            <a href="#4_details">the final section</a> explains each element of the user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that familiarity with both the TrapKAT and the TrapKAT manual are assumed (though some references are supplied).
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest of this section also assumes you have the program installed and it starts up okay.
        </p>

        <h2 id="2_1_settingUpANewKitLayout">Setting up a new kit layout</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine you have a new sound source for your TrapKAT and the layout is similar but not exactly the same as another kit
            you already have mapped up.
            Let us assume you have no reason to change the sound source to match the TrapKAT and that the TrapKAT has a spare user kit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are the steps you will need to follow to set up a new kit layout:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get the current TrapKAT All Memory Dump onto your computer.</li>
            <li>Edit the dump with <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="hilite">jTrapKATEditor.jar</span> to copy the similar kit and make changes.</li>
            <li>Save the edited dump.</li>
            <li>Send the updated dump back to the TrapKAT.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The first and last points are outside the scope of what jTrapKATEditor offers and differ substantially depending on whether you are running
            on Windows, MacOS or Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Windows, I still recommend MIDI-OX for receiving and sending MIDI System Exclusive dumps such as these.
            Receiving the dump using MIDI-OX is straight forward and no special settings are needed.
            The transmit settings for sending the dump - which are &quot;delicate&quot; due to timing issues - are given at the bottom of the
            <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="hilite">jTrapKATEditor.jar</span> main window.
        </p>

        <h2 id="2_2_loadTheDump">Load the dump</h2>
        <p>
            Once you have got the TrapKAT All Memory Dump onto your computer,
            run <span style="font-family: monospace;" class="hilite">jTrapKATEditor.jar</span>.
            It starts up with some rather useless default values but we are going to ignore those and load the dump.
            You can use the <span class="hilite"><span class="u">F</span>ile</span> menu, <span class="hilite"><span class="u">O</span>pen...</span> entry
            or press <span class="hilite">Ctrl/Cmd O</span>.
            This will bring up the following dialog box (or appropriate windowing system-specific flavour).
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="img/LoadSysex.png" title="Loading a SysEx dump" />
        </div>
        <p>
            You will notice that it filters for Sysex files.  It expects an extentions of &quot;syx&quot; to be used.
            If you did not save the received dump with that extension, I would recommend doing so
        </p>
        <p>
            Select the file you saved and press <span class="hilite">Enter</span> or click <span class="hilite">Open</span>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="2_3_copyOneKitToAnother">Copy one kit to another</h2>
        <p>
            The main display should now look similar to the following.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="img/Pads_PadEdit.png" title="Pad editing view" />
        </div>
        <p>
            Note that the <span class="hilite">Kits &amp; Pads</span> main tab is selected as is the <span class="hilite">Pad Details</span> subsidiary tab.
            As this was a Version 4 TrapKAT All Memory Dump (indicated in the title bar as &quot;(V4)&quot;), the <span class="hilite">More Slots</span> tab is available
            as well as <span class="hilite">Kit Details</span>.
            For this example, we will leave the tabs alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just below the <span class="hilite">Kits &amp; Pads</span> tab itself is the <span class="hilite">Select <span class="u">K</span>it</span> drop-down.
            Select the base kit that is going to be copied.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="img/SelectKit.png" title="Kit selection" />
        </div>
        <p>
            The pads now show the values for this newly selected kit, including the kit name.
            We want to copy this kit to one of the spare (&quot;Demo Kit #XX&quot;) entries.
            For this, select <span class="hilite"><span class="u">E</span>dit</span>-&gt;<span class="hilite">Copy Kit</span>.
            This places a copy of the kit on the system clip board, so it can be pasted elsewhere (even after closing the program).
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="img/EditCopyKit.png" title="Copying a kit" />
        </div>
        <p>
            Next we need to switch kits and do just that.
            So, use the <span class="hilite">Select <span class="u">K</span>it</span> drop-down to switch to the free kit and then
            <span class="hilite"><span class="u">E</span>dit</span>-&gt;<span class="hilite">Paste Kit...</span>.
            This pops up and dialog asking for confirmation of the action, as shown (with appropriate names and numbers).
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="img/RenumberKitOnPaste.png" title="Renumber on paste prompt" />
        </div>
        <p>
            Select <span class="hilite"><span class="u">Y</span>es</span> and the kit is overwritten with the copy.
            Note that the kit number is held for each kit - if you send a single kit to the TrapKAT, it uses this to know
            which user kit to write into.
        </p>

        <h2 id="2_4_changeTheKitLayout">Change the kit layout</h2>
        <p>
            We chose the source kit as &quot;similar but not the same&quot; as what we need.
            The things we want to alter are as follows.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The kit name</li>
            <li>The way the hi-hat works</li>
            <li>The pads for china and ride</li>
            <li>The note for the kick drum</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Changing the kit name is as simple as entering the new name in the <span class="hilite">Name</span> text field.  Done!
            Notice that the kit is marked &quot;Edited&quot; next to the <span class="hilite">Select <span class="u">K</span>it</span> drop-down.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this example, assume the old kit only had &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;bell&quot; hi-hat sounds,
            these mapped to pads 1 and 11.
            For the new kit, we now have &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;variable (CC4)&quot; hi-hat sounds we want to trigger from pad 1
            and the &quot;bell&quot; sound is unchanged.
            This means pad 1 needs to be marked as a hi-hat pad and to trigger two notes: one for when the hi-hat pedal is closed and one
            for when the hi-hat pedal is between (nearly) closed and fully open.
            We will assume the kit was already set to use a variable CC4 hi-hat pedal.
            The steps are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Set pad 1 to be a hi-hat pad</li>
            <li>Select pad 1</li>
            <li>Set slot 2 to be the variable note trigger</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Which pads are considered hi-hat pads by the TrapKAT is an interesting subject examined in detail later.
            For now, look near the middle of the window, where you should see a set of four drop-downs:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="img/ExampleTooltip.png" title="Hi-hat pad selection" />
        </div>
        <p>
            Use the first box (although that is not important) to select pad 1.  (Note the <span class="hilite">Flags</span> for the pad now have flag 7 checked.)
            Now use the <span class="hilite">Select <span class="u">P</span>ad</span> drop-down to select pad 1 (if it is not already selected).
            Notice that the pad is marked &quot;Edited&quot;.
        </p>
