<p>
	This is an initial release to get feedback.
	Note carefully that many things may change.
	One that must be highlighted is how preferences are handled.
	I have not yet written the custom handler I plan, so I am using
	the default JVM preferences system.
	On Windows, this uses the registry and
	<strong>MAY WELL FAIL</strong>
	unless you have the correct registry keys set up.
	This is an issue with the JVM itself.
	As this will be resolved at a later stage and because
	it is not that simple a fix, I am not going to supply details.
	If you are happy to find out what is needed using
	<em>your favourite search engine</em>,
	then please feel free to go ahead.
</p>
<p>
	I am particularly looking for feedback from non-Windows
	users.  I have a Windows machine and a Linux machine, so
	really it is just Mac users I need to hear from.
</p>
<p>
	This version of the program includes a feature to check online for
	new versions.
	Whilst noting the comment above, I do recommend turning on this
	preference.
</p>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>
	The program is stable - it does not generally crash all the time.
	If you can find a repeatable way to crash it, let me know,
	providing the console output.
	Most importantly, if you find a valid TrapKAT V3 or V4 sysex dump that
	it crashes on, please let me have the sysex dump with the console
	output from the program along.
</p>
<p>
	The program is almost non-functional.
	It has the simple functions of converting between V3 and V4 implemented.
	You can import a global dump into an existing (or new) all memory dump.
	As selecting a kit is not yet supported, no kit dump functions yet work.
	None of the user input fields displays values from the dump.
</p>
<p>
	Switching between V3 and V4 now updates some of the user interface
	to reflect the different facilities available.
	This is not yet completed and is needed before I can start properly
	"wiring up" the sysex data to the user interface.
