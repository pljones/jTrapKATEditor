<p>
	This is an initial release to get feedback.
	Note carefully that many things may change.
	One that must be highlighted is how preferences are handled.
	I have not yet written the custom handler I plan, so I am using
	the default JVM preferences system.
	On Windows, this uses the registry and
	<strong>MAY WELL FAIL</strong>
	unless you have the correct registry keys set up.
	This is an issue with the JVM itself.
	As this will be resolved at a later stage and because
	it is not that simple a fix, I am not going to supply details.
	If you are happy to find out what is needed using
	<em>your favourite search engine</em>,
	then please feel free to go ahead.
</p>
<p>
	I am particularly looking for feedback from non-Windows
	users.  I have a Windows machine and a Linux machine, so
	really it is just Mac users I need to hear from.
</p>
<p>
	This version of the program includes a feature to check online for
	new versions.
	Whilst noting the comment above, I do recommend turning on this
	preference.
</p>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>
	The program is stable - it does not generally crash all the time.
	If you can find a repeatable way to crash it, let me know,
	providing the console output.
	Most importantly, if you find a valid TrapKAT V3 or V4 sysex dump that
	it crashes on, please let me have the sysex dump with the console
	output from the program along.
</p>
<p>
	The exciting thing about this release is that it now allows editing
	pads and slots!
</p>
<p>
	On the downside, I found out that the expected "percolation of dirtiness"
	(that a change to a single slot value would indicate
	that the entire memory had changed)
	is not happening, so that is what I will be fixing next.
</p>
<p>
	I managed to tidy up some code around the comboboxes, too, which made me
	happier with them (and made getting the editing working a lot easier).
