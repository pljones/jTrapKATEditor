<p>
	This is an initial release to get feedback.
	Note carefully that many things may change.
	One that must be highlighted is how preferences are handled.
	I have not yet written the custom handler I plan, so I am using
	the default JVM preferences system.
	On Windows, this uses the registry and
	<strong>MAY WELL FAIL</strong>
	unless you have the correct registry keys set up.
	This is an issue with the JVM itself.
	As this will be resolved at a later stage and because
	it is not that simple a fix, I am not going to supply details.
	If you are happy to find out what is needed using
	<em>your favourite search engine</em>,
	then please feel free to go ahead.
</p>
<p>
	I am particularly looking for feedback from non-Windows
	users.  I have a Windows machine and a Linux machine, so
	really it is just Mac users I need to hear from.
</p>
<p>
	This version of the program includes a feature to check online for
	new versions.
	Whilst noting the comment above, I do recommend turning on this
	preference.
</p>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>
	Well... until the previous version, the program was relatively inert and
	hence stable.
	Now I have started "wiring up" the innards it is getting more crash-prone
	when you try to get it to do something.
	Hopefully I will start spotting problems before getting over-excited
	with new features and releasing untested...
</p>
<p>
	This particular release, then, is mostly about fixing some bugs -- long-standing ones
	that were not previously being triggered for the most part.
	Switching between V3 and V4 dumps and importing kits from one into the other
	should work (again) now.
