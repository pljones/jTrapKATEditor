<p>
	This is an initial release to get feedback.
	Note carefully that many things may change.
	One that must be highlighted is how preferences are handled.
	I have not yet written the custom handler I plan, so I am using
	the default JVM preferences system.
	On Windows, this uses the registry and
	<strong>MAY WELL FAIL</strong>
	unless you have the correct registry keys set up.
	This is an issue with the JVM itself.
	As this will be resolved at a later stage and because
	it is not that simple a fix, I am not going to supply details.
	If you are happy to find out what is needed using
	<em>your favourite search engine</em>,
	then please feel free to go ahead.
</p>
<p>
	I am particularly looking for feedback from non-Windows
	users.  I have a Windows machine and a Linux machine, so
	really it is just Mac users I need to hear from.
</p>
<p>
	This version of the program includes a feature to check online for
	new versions.
	Whilst noting the comment above, I do recommend turning on this
	preference.
</p>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>
	This version has all the existing UI components "wired up"
	- just the non-existent "Global" tab to go.
	Once more, version has also been substantially rewritten...
	partly to remove a rather glaring breakage of tabbing between
	fields.
	It does also include a rewrite of the code I rewrote for the last
	version, so do please expect the same raised chance of bugs.
	
</p>
<p>
	Getting the "Global" tab finished is next and then I will be
	doing more extensive testing (also known as using the software
	for real...).
