<p>
	This is an initial release to get feedback.
	Note carefully that many things may change.
	One that must be highlighted is how preferences are handled.
	I have not yet written the custom handler I plan, so I am using
	the default JVM preferences system.
	On Windows, this uses the registry and
	<strong>MAY WELL FAIL</strong>
	unless you have the correct registry keys set up.
	This is an issue with the JVM itself.
	As this will be resolved at a later stage and because
	it is not that simple a fix, I am not going to supply details.
	If you are happy to find out what is needed using
	<em>your favourite search engine</em>,
	then please feel free to go ahead.
</p>
<p>
	I am particularly looking for feedback from non-Windows
	users.  I have a Windows machine and a Linux machine, so
	really it is just Mac users I need to hear from.
</p>
<p>
	I would appreciate also hearing from people with the V3 ROM as I only
	have a limited amount of test data (i.e. what I saved before upgrading).
</p>
<p>
	The program includes a feature to check online for new versions once a day.
	I do recommend turning on this preference so you get to hear as
	soon as possible about fixes and updates.
</p>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>
	This version "completes" the UI - in the sense that it is all there.
	There is probably more to do on the Global tab but it should work,
	at least.
	As ever, if you do spot something wrong, get in touch.
</p>
<p>
	I guess I better now go and get the preferences system working in a compatible
	way with the .Net program...
