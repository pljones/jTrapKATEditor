<p>
	This is an initial release to get feedback.
	Note carefully that many things may change.
	One that must be highlighted is how preferences are handled.
	I have not yet written the custom handler I plan, so I am using
	the default JVM preferences system.
	On Windows, this uses the registry and
	<strong>MAY WELL FAIL</strong>
	unless you have the correct registry keys set up.
	This is an issue with the JVM itself.
	This will be resolved shortly, I hope, and because
	it is not that simple a fix, I am not going to supply details.
	If you are happy to find out what is needed using
	<em>your favourite search engine</em>,
	then please feel free to go ahead.
</p>
<p>
	I am particularly looking for feedback from non-Windows
	users.  I have a Windows machine and a Linux machine, so
	really it is just Mac users I need to hear from.
</p>
<p>
	I would appreciate also hearing from people with the V3 ROM as I only
	have a limited amount of test data (i.e. what I saved before upgrading).
</p>
<p>
	The program includes a feature to check online for new versions once a day.
	I do recommend turning on this preference so you get to hear as
	soon as possible about fixes and updates.
</p>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>
	This version "completes" the UI (*cough*) - including Pad and Kit copy/paste.
	Edit Undo/Redo are not yet done (they never were in the C# version, either)
	but I have some thoughts.
	They may get enabled later.
	Preference handling is next, though.
</p>
<p>
	As ever, if you do spot something wrong, get in touch.
