<p>
	This is an initial release to get feedback.
	I am particularly looking for feedback from non-Windows
	users.  I have a Windows machine and a Linux machine, so
	whilst I particularly need to hear from Mac users,
	all input is appreciated.
</p>
<p>
	I would also like to hear from people with the V3 ROM as I only
	have a limited amount of test data (i.e. what I saved before upgrading).
</p>
<p>
	The program includes a feature to check online for new versions once a day.
	I do recommend turning on this preference so you get to hear as
	soon as possible about fixes and updates.
</p>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>
	The new preferences system is now complete.
	On all platforms, preferences are stored in an XML text file.
	The location is platform dependent.
	On Windows, it is "%APPDATA\Peter L Jones\jTrapKATEditor.xml".
	On Linux, it is "$HOME/.peter_l_jones/jTrapKATEditor.xml".
	I am not entirely sure where it will end up on MacOS.
</p>
<p>
	As ever, if you do spot something wrong, get in touch.
