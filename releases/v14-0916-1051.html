<h3>Two bugs fixed</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Saving a kit wrote a bad kit dump - the kit name was missing.</li>
	<li>Cut and paste of kits was not working (similar problem).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>
	I now consider this version to be in &quot;Beta testing&quot;.
	It is intended to be fully useful on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
	I am aware of some problems on Windows and would appreciate
	feedback from non-Windows users, particularly on MacOS.
</p>
<p>
	I would also like to hear from people with the V3 ROM as I only
	have a limited amount of test data (i.e. what I saved before upgrading).
</p>
<p>
	The program includes a feature to check online for new versions once a day.
	I do recommend turning on this preference so you get to hear as
	soon as possible about fixes and updates.
