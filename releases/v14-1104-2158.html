<h3>Updates</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Undo/redo!
		As expected it took a bit of time but once I had got an idea of
		how to do it, it was pretty straight forward.
		It actually made the code a lot nicer, so I am hoping
		it hasn't added too many bugs.
		It certainly fixed a fair number!
	</li>

<h3>What&apos;s next?</h3>
<p>
	Uh, of course, the moment I did the build, I spotted some missing
	translation strings.  Those will get fixed shortly.
	Also, the tooltips could do with making more useful on the Global tab...
