<h3>Updates</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Undo/redo, extended...
		Yes, I missed a bit.
		Edit/Paste Pad and Edit/Swap Pads can now be undone.
	</li>
	<li>
		I have also "fixed it" so that the undo/redo history gets
		cleared when things that can't be undone change things.
		Such as File/New or File/Open.
		At the moment, this also includes
		Edit/Paste Kit and Edit/Swap Kits.
		That may change.
	</li>
	<li>
		Yes, the global tab now really does have tool tips.
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>What&apos;s next?</h3>
<p>
	Probably undo/redo for kit.
