<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>
	Well, that took a while.
</p>
<p>
	I decided I needed to examine the problem with the Windows
	nastybug (losing UI updates).
	It appears to have gone away.
	But only after I took apart the internal workings and rewrote
	them, so there is a fairly high probability of my having
	broken other things.
</p>
<h3>What&apos;s next?</h3>
<p>
	Watching for lurking bugs for a while, I think...
</p>
<h3>Current status</h3>
<p>
	Whilst the previous version was considered a &quot;Beta testing&quot;
	release, I would say this is back to &quot;Alpha test&quot;, at least
	for this release.
	I will be using it as it seems to be working better on Windows than
	the previous versions and I will fix any bugs I spot but, as ever,
	drop me a line if you spot anything I miss.
