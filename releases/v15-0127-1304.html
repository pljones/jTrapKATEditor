		<h3>Updates</h3>
		<p>
			Another (minor) bug fixed -- editing the kit name didn't update
			the kit list correctly.
		</p>
		<h3>What&apos;s next?</h3>
		<p>
			Keep watching for lurking bugs for a while, I think...
		</p>
		<h3>Current status</h3>
		<p>
			I am reasonably happy to re-instate the &quot;Beta&quot; status now.
			I have been using it as it seems to be working better on Windows than
			the previous versions.  I will continue fix any bugs I spot but, as ever,
			drop me a line if you spot anything I miss.
