	<h3>Updates</h3>
	<p>
		Version checks now rely on GitHub.
		The program was crashing on start up for me when checking for new updates
		on Linux (only).
		I have put in a &quot;fix&quot; that seems to work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Online help is now on GitHub.
		The program was also having trouble starting the web browser on Linux (only).
		I have put in another means of starting the browser that works here.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the program is pretty much &quot;done&quot;, I finally added the
		warranty and licence info to the Help menu.
	</p>
	<p>
		And, as ever, I also made a few code improvements.
	</p>
	<h3>Current status</h3>
	<p>
		This is now considered a release version.
