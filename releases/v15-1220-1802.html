	<h3>Updates</h3>
	<p>
        One more bug fixed -- I had missed that the sound control volume got passed in for the V3 kit layout, so it needed adjusting too.
        Note that I cannot test V3 other than loading saved dumps.
        Note also, if I remember correctly, there is known to be something weird about &quot;Bank&quot; in certain V3 TrapKATs versions.
        Use &quot;Bank MSB&quot; and &quot;Bank LSB&quot; if you have them and just ignore &quot;Bank&quot;.
	</p>
	<h3>Current status</h3>
	<p>
		This is now considered a release version.
