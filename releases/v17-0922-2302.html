	<h3>Updates</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The big news today is support for the TrapKAT V5 ROM.
			I had (wrongly) thought this was the same as V4 but there were subtle differences.
			This is, of course, the first round of support so...
			<ul>
				<li>
					It is not complete:
					there are clearly "new bits" that I do not understand as I only have a V4.
				</li>
				<li>
					There may be bugs in the V5 support.
				</li>
				<li>
					I may have broken V3 and V4 support.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			In other news, whilst doing the above, I found that I had done a bad job on supporting
			kit names.  Many places they should have been copied / set were missing.
			Hopefully I found them all.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Current status</h3>
	<p>
		I would say beta for V5 support; release for the rest.
		As always, please DO report bugs - either on GitHub or the AlternateMode forum thread.
	</p>
